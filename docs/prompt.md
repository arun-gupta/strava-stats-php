## Generate plan.md from requirements.md

Read the contents of docs/requirements.md and create a detailed development plan
describing how to implement these requirements.

The plan should include:

– A short overview of the goal.

– The main steps or phases required to achieve it.

– Any dependencies, risks, or considerations to keep in mind.

Do not write or modify any code yet. Save the plan as docs/plan.md.

## Generate tasks.md from plan.md

Read the contents of docs/plan.md and generate a detailed, enumerated task list based on it in docs/tasks.md

Each task should be clear, actionable, and written in a way that allows it to be marked as completed once done.

Maintain a logical order of execution. Group the tasks logically into phases.

Save the result as tasks.md, formatted as a numbered list with checkboxes (for example, - [ ] Implement data repository).

Do not start implementing any tasks yet—only create the list.
